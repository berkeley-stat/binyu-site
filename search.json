Topics: optimal prediction rules, the curse of dimensionality, empirical risk, linear regression and classification, basis expansions, regularization, splines, the bootstrap, model selection, classification and regression trees, boosting, support vector machines. Computational efficiency versus predictive performance. Emphasis on experience with real data and assessing statistical assumptions. This course uses Python as its primary computing language; details are determined by the instructor.\nThis is an introductory-level course in supervised learning, with a focus on regression and classification methods. The syllabus includes: linear regression, model assessment, model selection, regularization methods (PCR, PLSR, ridge and lasso); logistic regression and discriminant analysis; cross-validation and the bootstrap; tree-based methods, random forests and boosting; support-vector machines. Some unsupervised learning methods are discussed: principal components and clustering (k-means and hierarchical).\nIn this course, students explore the predictive modeling lifecycle, including question formulation, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and visualization, model building, model assessment/validation, model selection, and decision-making. The course focuses on quantitative critical thinking and key principles needed to carry out this cycle: 1) Foundational principles for building predictive models; 2) Intuitive explanations of many commonly used predictive modeling techniques for both classification and regression problems; 3) Principles and steps for validating a predictive model; and 4) write and use computer code to perform the necessary foundational work to build and validate predictive models.\nPrerequisites: Mathematics 53 or equivalent; Mathematics 54, Electrical Engineering 16A, Statistics 89A, Mathematics 110 or equivalent linear algebra; Statistics 135, the combination of Data/Stat C140 and Data/Stat/Compsci C100, or equivalent; experience with some programming language. Recommended prerequisite: Mathematics 55 or equivalent exposure to counting arguments.\nCourse Website: [STAT 154]\n\n\n\nCourse Description: Applied statistics and machine learning, focusing on answering scientific questions using data, the data science life cycle, critical thinking, reasoning, methodology, and trustworthy and reproducible computational practice. Hands-on experience in open-ended data labs, using programming languages such as R and Python. Emphasis on understanding and examining the assumptions behind standard statistical models and methods and the match between the assumptions and the scientific question. Exploratory data analysis. Model formulation, fitting, model testing and validation, interpretation, and communication of results. Methods include linear regression and generalizations, decision trees, random forests, simulation, and randomization methods.\nPrerequisites: Linear algebra, calculus, upper division probability and statistics, and familiarity with high-level programming languages.

She is a member of National Academy of Sciences and currently serves on the editorial board of Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).\nProfessor Bin Yu recieved a BS Degree in Mathematics from Peking University, and MS and Ph.D. in Statistics from UC Berkeley. She was a Member of Technical Staff at Lucent Bell-Labs, Distinguished Researcher in the Deep Learning Group of Microsoft Research, Assistant Professor at UW-Madison, and Miller Research Professor at Berkeley. She was a Visiting Faculty at MIT, Peking University, Newton Institute at Cambridge University, ETH, Yale University, Flatiron Institute, Poincare Institute, INRIA-Paris, and Fields Institute at University of Toronto.\nProfessor Bin Yu has published many research papers and one book, Veridical Data Science (MIT Press, 2024). Her research focuses on developing trustworthy and interpretable machine learning methods, with particular emphasis on the Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework for veridical data science. She has made fundamental contributions to statistical theory, including pioneering work on Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) theory for time series analysis, minimum description length (MDL) and entropy estimation, sparse modeling, boosting, spectral clustering, and MCMC convergence analysis. Her applied work spans neuroscience, genomics, remote sensing, and precision medicine, always emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration with domain experts. Currently, she leads research in interpretable machine learning (including tree-based methods and deep learning interpretability), causal inference, and the development of stable, reproducible methods for scientific discovery. Her group has developed influential algorithms such as iterative random forests (iRF), contextual decomposition for transformers, and adaptive wavelet distillation for interpreting neural networks.\nProfessor Bin Yu has received many awards and honors throughout her career. She has been elected to the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Her major awards include the Guggenheim Fellowship, COPSS E. L. Scott Prize, and most recently, the COPSS Distinguished Achievement Award and Lecture (DAAL) (formerly Fisher Award and Lecture) at JSM in 2023. She has delivered several distinguished lectures, including the Wald Memorial Lectures of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS), the Tukey Memorial Lecture of the Bernoulli Society, and the Rietz Lecture of IMS. She holds an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Lausanne in Switzerland.\nProfessor Bin Yu has held many leadership positions in the statistical and data science communities. She served as President of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS) and was Chair of the Department of Statistics at UC Berkeley from 2009 to 2012. She served on the Inaugural Scientific Committee of the UK Turing Institute for Data Science and AI. Her editorial leadership includes current service on the Editorial Board of Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), and previous service on editorial boards of Annals of Statistics, Journal of American Statistical Association, and Journal of Machine Learning Research. Her committee and advisory work includes co-chairing the National Scientific Committee of the Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute (SAMSI), serving on scientific advisory committees of SAMSI and IPAM, and on the board of trustees of ICERM and the Board of Governors of IEEE-IT Society. She recently served on the scientific advisory committee for the IAS Special Year on optimization, statistics and theoretical machine learning, and the Scientific Advisory Boards of Canadian Statistical Sciences Institute (CANSSI). Currently, she serves on the advisory board of the AI Policy Hub at UC Berkeley, the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Department of Quantitative and Computational Biology at USC, and on the External Advisory Committee for Learning the Earth with Artificial Intelligence and Physics (LEAP), an NSF Science and Technology Center (STC), at Columbia University. She is a Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub Investigator and Weill Neurohub Investigator. She is a member of the UC Berkeley Center for Computational Biology and serves as a scientific advisor at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing."
