## Welcome

Professor Bin Yu is the head of the Yu Group at Berkeley, which consists of
12-15 students and postdocs from Statistics and EECS. She was formally trained
as a statistician, but her research interests and achievements extend beyond
the realm of statistics. Together with her group,  Bin Yu has leveraged new
computational developments to solve important scientific problems by combining
novel and often interpretable statistical machine learning approaches with the
domain expertise of my many collaborators in neuroscience, genomics and
precision medicine. She also develops relevant theory to understand random
forests and deep learning for insight into and guidance for practice.  Her work
has been recongized by many awards. In particular, she was inducted to the
National Academy of Sciences in 2014 and to the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences in 2013. She delivered the IMS Wald Lectures and COPSS Distinguished
Achievement and Award Lecture (DAAL, formerly Fisher Award and Lecture) in 2023.

She and her team have developed the PCS framework for veridical data science (or
responsible, reliable, and transparent data analysis and decision-making). PCS
stands for predictability, computability and stability, and it unifies,
streamlines, and expands on ideas and best practices of machine learning and
statistics.

In order to augment empirical evidence for decision-making, they are
investigating statistical machine learning methods/algorithms (and associated
statistical inference problems) such as dictionary learning, non-negative matrix
factorization (NMF), EM and deep learning (CNNs and LSTMs), and heterogeneous
effect estimation in randomized experiments (X-learner). Their recent algorithms
include staNMF for unsupervised learning, iterative Random Forests (iRF) and
signed iRF (s-iRF) for discovering predictive and stable high-order interactions
in supervised learning, next generation tree-based methods (e.g. fast and
interpretable greedy-tree sums (FIGS) and hierarchical shrinked (HS) trees, and
RF+), contextual decomposition (CD), aggregated contextual decomposition (ACD),
and adaptive wavelet distillation (AWD) for interpretation of Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs).
